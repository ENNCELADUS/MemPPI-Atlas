- No duplicate codeâ€”reuse existing functions.
- Extend existing files unless a new file is necessary.
- Justify each dependency.
- Prefer the smallest working solution, keep every module under 500 lines. If larger than 500 lines, refactor it into smaller components.
- Consistent naming: camelCase for functions/vars, PascalCase for classes/components.
- Prioritize clarity and readability over micro-optimizations.
- Write correct, secure, up-to-date, bug-free code.
- Treat users as experts; keep explanations brief and precise.
