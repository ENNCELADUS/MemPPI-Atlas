description: Naming, code style, patterns (DI, API layer), folder conventions

- No duplicate codeâ€”reuse existing functions.
- Extend existing files unless a new file is necessary.
- Justify each dependency.
- Prefer the smallest working solution.
- Consistent naming: camelCase for functions/vars, PascalCase for classes/components.
