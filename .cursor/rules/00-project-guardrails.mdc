- First propose a plan; wait for confirmation before coding.
- Only modify files explicitly named; no side effects elsewhere.
- Do the simplest thing that works; justify any new dependency.
- Reuse existing functions; no duplicate code.
- After coding: print a short self-check list of what changed and why.
