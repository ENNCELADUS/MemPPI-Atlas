- REST conventions: nouns for resources, plural collections, query params for filters.
- Pagination: `limit` (1â€“100) and `offset` (>=0); always return `total`.
- Validation: enforce bounds on `minProb`, validate `accession`, sanitize `tissue`.
- Errors: return a consistent envelope `{ error: { code, message } }` and proper HTTP status.
- CSV Data Access:
  - Stream reads; avoid loading entire files into memory.
  - Normalize `Expression.tissue` by splitting on backslash (`\\`).
  - Treat `NA` as missing.
- Performance: prefer server-side filtering/sorting; add simple caching for hot queries.
- Security: disable directory listing; validate download parameters to prevent injection.
