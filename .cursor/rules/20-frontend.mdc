- Prefer a simple, conventional framework (e.g., React/Next) but keep code framework-agnostic where possible.
- Components:
  - Keep components small and focused; colocate styles and tests.
  - Lift state only when needed; prefer props and composition.
- State:
  - Use lightweight state for local UI; avoid global state unless necessary.
  - Debounce search input; reflect filters in URL query params.
- Data fetching:
  - Centralize API client; handle loading/error/empty states.
  - Paginate on the server; never fetch unbounded lists.
- Styling:
  - Use a consistent design token system; avoid ad-hoc inline styles.
  - Ensure accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation).
